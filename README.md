ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Eivind! I am passionate about programming and love exploring new technologies. I have experience in several programming languages, including Java, Python, and JavaScript. I enjoy working on challenging projects and collaborating with others to solve complex problems. When I'm not coding, you can usually find me playing video games or watching movies. Feel free to check out my GitHub profile to see what I'm currently working on!
